# Take home assignment for Latitude
Chris and Eugene, thank you for taking the time to check out my take-home! I completed this project as a web deployment using Svelte, and I've provided two methods of viewing the project.

1. This app is deployed live on https://coreymaroney.github.io/Latitude/

2. If you'd prefer to run this locally on your system, follow the standard procedure below.
## Running this project locally

Clone the project to your local system (this is using HTTPS)
### `git clone https://github.com/coreymaroney/Latitude.git`
## Navigate into  the project repository using
### `cd Latitude`
## Install the dependencies

### `npm install`

## Run the web deployment
### `npm run dev`
